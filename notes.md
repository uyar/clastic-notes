# Notes about Clastic

Some notes, thoughts, and questions without any particular order.

## Route decorators

The cline application under the `examples` directory uses route decorators.
Other examples don't use them.
Considering that these might make route ordering difficult,
are they still valid, or are they deprecated/discouraged?


## Testing

Clastic's parameter injection makes it very easy
to unit test endpoint functions.
No need to instantiate an app or a client (even using `get_local_client()`).
Passing a dummy context is easy (only a dict),
but is there a way to pass a dummy request for functions
that want to access the `request` built-in?

## Application termination

Is there a way of running some code when the application exits?
Like closing database connections?


## Static resources

The default settings for static resources are confusing.
Setting the default value of `use_static` to `False`
and deprecating the feature after a few versions might be a good idea.

What's the use case for the `static_prefix` setting?

As a related note,
the webtop application uses `META_ASSETS_APP` for serving static assets
(if I understand correctly).
It would be better if all examples followed the same design,
it gets confusing when looking at the example application codes.


## obj_browser app

Is this something like traversal routing in Pyramid/Morepath?
